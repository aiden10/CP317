Next, host the server on your local network by running the Server.py file.

Lastly, run: `python -m http.server 3000` to host the front end. 

# Usage
Once the GSFT application is running locally on your device, navigate to `localhost:3000/register` to create a new account. You will automatically be redirected to the dashboard.
